# Welcome to Test-Game. 
`*name is still a work in progress`
## What is Test-Game about?
Test-Game is a current project of mine. A 2D game with no current story/object other than to build and mine. It is really limited at what you can do in the game. There is crafting, limited inventory, and working day and night cycle. This uses Java's AWT.
## What are the plan for future?
### High priority plans are.
* World generation
* Exploration and not limiting the player to the 20 by 10 block area.
* Many fixes to the player.
### Lower priotiy plans are.
* Main Menu/ Game launcher.
* Optional story lines.
* Multi-player
## How to build / run it?
Currently I would recommend using Intellij Idea.
Clone the repository and Open `build.gradle` as a Project. Then you should be all set.
To build a runnable jar file you would run the command `.\gradlew jar` then look in `build\lib` folder the launch `game-MMDDYYYY-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
